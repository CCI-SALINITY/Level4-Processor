The L4 processing chain intends to produce:
-	Weekly L4 and
-	Monthly L4

Both products are formatted in netcdf and are in conformance with the data format convention applied on the CCI projects 

<b>Satellite data</b>

The main sources of satellite based SSS data are:
-	SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity)
-	AQUARIUS
-	SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)

Other sensor data such AMSR will appear in the next phase of the project (Year 2, 3).
