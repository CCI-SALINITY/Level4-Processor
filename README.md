The L4 processing chain intends to produce:
-	Weekly L4 and
-	Monthly L4

Both products are formatted in netcdf and are in conformance with the data format convention applied on the CCI projects 

<b>Satellite data</b>

The main sources of satellite based SSS data are:
-	SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity)
-	AQUARIUS
-	SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive)

Other sensor data such AMSR will appear in the next phase of the project (Year 2, 3).

The input data coverage is detailed in the following figures:
